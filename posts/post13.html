                        <p><b>Name:</b> Tracy</p>
                        <p><b>Age:</b> 7</p> 
                        <p><b>Gender:</b> Female</p>
                        <p><b>Family Situation:</b> Tracy comes from a traditional household with two working parents. They work late or attend after work functions, so Tracy is left to her own devices or to whatever the babysitter plans.</p>
                        <p><b>Attitudes:</b> Tracy prefers to play with her dolls and read books. She is  quiet child that isn't interested in exercise or sports.</p>
                        <p><b>Motivation:</b> Tracy’s parents are motivated to help her learn healthy social habits, and want to ensure that she has the proper soft skills to ensure her future success in the workforce. They are afraid their careers prevent them from spending enough time with tracy and feel guilty about it.</p>

                    <h1>User 2</h1>
                        <p><b>Name:</b> Max</p>
                        <p><b>Age:</b> 9</p>
                        <p><b>Gender:</b> Male</p>
                        <p><b>Family Situation</b>: Max comes from a single parent household. His dad works the night shift as a medical laboratory researcher. Max’s Grandma functions as a childcare provider during his dad’s shifts.</p>
                        <p><b>Attitudes:</b> Max loves to play games, both indoors and out. His grandma is elderly and needs to rest, leaving Max to entertain himself after he finishes his homework. Max is very curious and loves to learn new things. He often becomes tired of games that don't present him with new challenges.</p>
                        <p><b>Motivation:</b> Max’s dad is concerned that his Grandma is not helping Max develop proper social skills, and she has an outdated world view and was never employed outside of the home. Max is accelerated, and his dad wants to make sure that his age and lack of maturity doesn't hold him back from all that he is capable of.</p>
