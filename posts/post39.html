  <h3>Process and User Testing</h3>
  <p>In order to user test my proof of concept, I wanted to create a complete flow. My first step was to user test the onboarding screens. While the explanation of the app's purpose and selection of diseases to prescreen for was clear, the financial commitment was problematic. A key part of the app, it was important that users understood the purpose and how it worked.</p>
  <p>The first iteration requested $100 up front, which users felt was cost prohibitive. The second iteration allowed for users to pledge their own amount, which turned out to be too vague, and enabled users to adjust the stakes based off of what they were willing to use. The third iteration was the most successful, with users allowing $10 a month to be withdrawn automatically.</p>

  <img class="img-responsive mw70"  src="../img/midterm/venmo.png" alt="onboarding">
</div>
</div>
  <p>My next steps will be to iterate upon where the money not earned back by users go. Some possible options are the app keeping the funds to make a profit, distribution to other more adherent users, or to fund healthcare for users without health insurace.</<p>
  <p>The dashboard was also important to iterate and test. Several iterations of the layout were presented to users in order to clarify the hierachy of information, color signafier clarity, and ease of use.</p>
  <p>My next steps will be to iterate on the overall activity chart at the bottom. In its current state, the information presented doesnt provide much value to the users. I will either need to identify why that information is important and add more clear markers to the graph, or replace it with something else.</p>
  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <img class="img-responsive mw70"  src="../img/midterm/dashboard.png" alt="login">
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
    <img class="img-responsive mw70"  src="../img/midterm/hr.png" alt="login2">
  </div>
  </div>
  <p>A sample appointment screen was created in order to test the visuals as well as the tone of the information provided. The orange HR on the dashboard clearly indicated to the user that this area needed attention. This text turns back to black after an appointment is scheduled, letting the user know they have taken action to correct the problem. The icon like imagery of the heart was clinical, but not too scary and the text provided qualifing informtion about the importance of the appointment without speaking down to the user, or presenting information that was hard to digest. It was clear to users that they could click on the calendar from either the dashboard or the HR page to schedule an appointment.</p>
  <p>In future iterations I would like to expermient with providing ways for users to do home checks. This may not work for every disease the user is prescreening for, but might be a way to provide more constant feedback. Additionally I would like to user test the progress bar, to make sure that it is clear how often it resets.</p>
  <br>
<h3>Feedback Response</h3>
<p>Based on the midterm feedback, I would like to consider other ways of actively engaging the user in the application besides data entry. A physical component to the project might allow for users to be more aware of their status without the need for constant constant reminders. Ideally the physical element would also fit with the goal of providing an additional form of motivation to the user. Additionally, experimenting with ways to do home checks and provide more constant feedback would be extremely valuable.</p>
