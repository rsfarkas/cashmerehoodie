                    <p>The thought of writing a blog is daunting.</p>

                    <p>As MFADT students we are expected to push ourselves outside our comfort zones in order to better understand the world of design. I intend to document my experiences here and hope they may help me receive feedback and better reflect upon my work.</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Developing a Concept</h2>

                    <p>Developing an interesting concept is the first challenge. While the purpose of Cashmere Hoodie is to record the process of my Major Studio 1 assignments, it is important to me that it also document my journey as a creative technologist.</p>

                    <p>At Bootcamp I learned that my interests are many and varied. The problem with this discovery is that when attempting to articulate who I am as a designer, I feel lost. I see the options as many with no path specifically clearly calling my name. For now, I feel pretty confident that I would like to gain the technological skills needed to help me create products which make information more accessible.</p>

                    <blockquote>The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential.<br>-Steve Ballmer</blockquote>

                    <p>The former CEO of Microsoft greatly inspired the concept for the blog. To investigate how technology can allow me to be creative, to learn new things, and to share that experience and knowledge with others. I hope to inspire other people to believe that they have the potential and ability to learn whatever they set their mind to.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Writing the Code</h2>

                    <p>Starting out with a basic bootstrap template was a huge timesaver. Having the basic columns laid out, I was able to move on to creating my page layouts. I kept the site design simple in order to ensure the posts were easy to read and the navigation was accessible.</p>

                    <p>I sourced my images from <a href="https://unsplash.com">unsplash.com</a>, which curates images from photographers and distrbutes them for free. I then linked my relevant social media pages in the footer.The greatest challenge I faced while creating this project included inserting the footer using jQuery.</p>
