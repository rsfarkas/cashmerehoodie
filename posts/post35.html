  <h3>Concept Statement</h3>
  <p>Providing a clear visual representation of a user’s health will motivate them to make healthier choices.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Purpose of Prototype</h3>
  <p>The purpose of my prototype is to determine which visual indicators of health information most effectively engage users.</p>
  <br>
  <h3>Research Summary</h3>
  <h4>Domain Diagram</h4>
  <p>In order to refocus on my project, I began the week by redoing my domain diagrams.</p>
  <img class="img-responsive"  src="../img/domainDiagram1.png" alt="domainDiagram1">
  <p>After completing this diagram I realized that it was too horizontal, and that I needed to develop subdomains in order to figure out where my project truly sat.</p>
  <img class="img-responsive"  src="../img/domainDiagram2.png" alt="domainDiagram2">
  <p>My second diagram placed patient monitoring, adherence, and access to healcare on the same level. After some critical thought I realized that the problem of patient adherence really sits within access healthcare and healthcare literacy. My project really falls into the space of young adult behavior within these two domains. My third domain map positioned my project in a much clearer space.<p>

    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>After conducting user and target market research last week, I realized what was missing with my concept. Users ultimelty need a program that provides them with motivation, either intrinsic or extrinsic, to keep participating. In order to help me layout my thoughts I generated my two user flows.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive"  src="../img/UserFlow1.png" alt="UserFlow">
    <br>
    <img class="img-responsive"  src="../img/UserFlow2.png" alt="UserFlow">
    <br>
    <h4>User Scenarios</h4>
    <p>In order to help myself imagine a solution that would fit my target audience, I created several user personas.</p>
    <h5>User Scenario Pair 1</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b> Lucas Mccormick</li>
      <li><b>Age:</b> 18</li>

      <li><b>Mentality:</b> Lucas is interested in as doing as little as possible before he heads off to UMichigan. His main pastime is drinking and playing pool in his friend Mike’s basement.</li>
      <li><b>Motivations:</b>  Lucas plans on playing baseball at UMichigan and wants to make sure he is healthy enough. Lucas also doesn’t want to put in any extra effort.</li>
      <li><b>External factors affecting use:</b> Lucas is receiving a lot of pressure from his mom and baseball couch to start taking responsibility for himself, as they wont be at school with him next year.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b>  Georgia McCormick</li>
      <li><b>Environment:</b> Georgia is a stay home mom in the suburbs of Atlanta.</li>
      <li><b>Age:</b> 38</li>

      <li><b>Motivations:</b> Georgia wants to make sure that Lucas will be fine when he goes off to school in the fall. He often gets sick and doesn’t change his habits, and forgets to tell her when he needs immunizations for school. Georgia knows she needs to let go, but doesn’t feel like she can until Lucas shows that he is ready. </li>
      <li><b>External factors affecting use:</b> Georgia’s husband travels frequently for work, and she needs an easier way to manage her children. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h5>User Scenario Pair 2</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b> Emily Jackson</li>
      <li><b>Age:</b> 22</li>
      <li><b>Environment:</b> Apartment off campus.</li>

      <li><b>External factors affecting use:</b> Emily is pretty busy wrapping up her studies, as well as adjusting to life in Boston all on her own. Emily has also started dating someone knew, and seems to have a lot less free time to dedicate to herself.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>

      <li><b>Motivations:</b>  Arlene would like to have as little responsibility for Emily as possible.</li>
      <li><b>External factors affecting use:</b> Extremely busy with business.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

      <li><b>Age:</b> 20</li>
      <li><b>Environment:</b> Anne is a sophomore in college at UCLA. She lives on campus, but is still covered by her father’s health insurance. Anne is part of a sorority and spends most of her free time training for half marathons.</li>

      <li><b>Motivations:</b>  Find ways to learn more about her health, and what to do when something doesn’t feel quite right. Anne also wants to focus on preventative care, since her mother’s death made her keenly aware of the fragility of life.</li>
      <li><b>External factors affecting use:</b> Anne wants to use something friendly, which is isn’t embarrassing to use since her living situation doesn’t give her much privacy.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b> Edwin Potter</li>
      <li><b>Age:</b> 57</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 >Color Palette User Testing</h4>
    <p>After analyzing the results of my color palette user testing, I settled on a color palette which includes colors that attract young adults, as well as instill feelings of health, prosperity, and professionalism. </p>

    <h4>User Testing Results</h4>
    <p>Users were presented with all four iterations. Each user was asked to explain what the color indications on the body meant and how it made them feel.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Red and green colors together make it difficult to understand the meaning</li>
      <li>Body outlines with actual defined parts (heart, intestines, are disconcerting)</li>
      <li>Green filling up the body would be more clear with a percentage marked</li>
      <li>Exterinsic incentives such as financial gain would help generate initial excitement</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Possible Incentive Systems</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Financial incentives- parents give incentives to young adults to encourage them to be independant</li>
        <li>Health score based of preventative care measures gives discounts on insurance premiums</li>
        <li>Partnering with universities to give discounts on student health insurance</li>
        <li>Social sharing- users will feel incentives to participate to maintain a good image</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Prototype Critique</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>While the prototype was great for figuring out what visual elements convey health fulfilment, it didnt clarify the incentive system</li>
      <li>Didn't address helping users know which parts of their body needed to be checked</li>
    </ul>
