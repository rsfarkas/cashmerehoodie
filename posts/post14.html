                    <h1>User Scenario 1</h1>
                        <p><b>Name:</b> Tracy</p>
                        <p><b>Age:</b> 7</p> 
                        <p><b>Gender:</b> Female</p>
                        <p><b>Scenario A:</b> Tracy is home after school and finishes her homework a few hours before bed. Tracy has gotten bored of her most recent book, and wants to do something a bit more engaging. She has been having a tough time at school with a friend she believes that she might have offended, and is feeling a bit down. Her parents wont be home until later and she doesn't feel comfortable confiding in the babysitter. Tracy pulls out Benny the Monkey. When she squeezes his arm she can see his heartbeat which she finds comforting. Tracy goes on an adventure with Benny where she is able to learn to navigate difficult situations with friends and communication. Tracy feels better prepared to go to school tomorrow and patch things up with her friend Liz.</p>
                        <p><b>Scenario B:</b> Tracy and her family are taking a road trip to visit her grandparents for the weekend. They will be in the car for a total of 4 hours. Her dad likes to play oldies while driving and her mom is busy fielding work calls. Tracy decides to bring Benny along for the ride as a source of entertainment. Her parents are happy that she isn't complaining about the ride, and Tracy is distracted so she doesn't feel too cooped up.</p>

                    <h1>User Scenario 2</h1>
                        <p><b>Name:</b> Max</p>
                        <p><b>Age:</b> 9</p>
                        <p><b>Gender:</b> Male</p>
                        <p><b>Scenario A:</b> Max has free time on Sunday before his dad gets off of work to take him to soccer practice. His Grandma is busy watching the news and folding laundry, and so Max can't watch any TV. Max grabs Benny the Monkey and decides to go on adventure. He loves solving the problems because he thinks its very funny when Benny the Monkey vibrates! Max goes on a few adventures with Benny in order to pass the time. He has been struggling to be assertive at soccer practice, and really admires Benny's ability to take charge! Max likes playing with Benny more than reading books, as he feels like he can relate to Benny, since he plays soccer too!</p>
                         <p><b>Scenario B:</b> Max takes the school bus home, but his dad drops him off in the mornings. Max gets dropped off early before school on Wednesdays and Thursdays in order to accommodate his dad's work schedule. Since Max finishes all of his homework the night before so that it can be checked by his grandma or dad, he likes to take Benny with him in the morning to play with. Max's dad likes to pack Benny for Max because he wants to make sure he doesn't start to play less productive games instead.</p>
