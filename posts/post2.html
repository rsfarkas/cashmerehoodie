                    <p> For my second 5 in 5 project I wanted to investigate the stereotypes associated with people who work with technology and the way they dress. After reading <a href ="http://www.marketplace.org/2014/01/28/tech/silicon-valley-has-dress-code-you-better-believe-it">Silicon Valley has a dress code? You better believe it</a>, I wanted to explore what it means to dress like a certain job, and if these dress code stereotypes were actually inhibiting women from progressing in the industry.</p>

                    <p> One passage in particular, “Hoodie signals young talent,” really stuck with me. My blog name came from a funny conversation with my family when I first shared my interest in learning to code with them. As I had previously attended fashion school, they joked that if I ever wore a hoodie it would have to be cashmere.</p>

                    <p>I believe that clothing is necessary not only for utility, but also for self expression. The stereotype of the talented engineer who dresses in jeans and a hoodie everyday is outdated. As more and more women enter the field, new looks will emerge that provide the same comfort and practicality levels and allow for greater self-expression.</p>

                    <p>With that in mind, I started the process of reimagining the developer dress code.</p>

                   <h2 class="section-heading">Process</h2>

                   <p>I started the process with a fashion croquie from <a href ="http://www.designersnexus.com"> designersnexus.com.</p> 

                     <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" id="imgsmall" src="../img/template.png" alt="fashion croquies">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Croquis</span>

                    <p>I sketched out my ideas using Adobe Illustrator. I reimagined the classic hoodie as a bomber jacket, one of the essential pieces for Fall 2016. Just like the hoodie the jacket provides warmth, storage in the form of pockets, and comfort. Instead of jeans, I imagined a pencil skirt. While still versatile and casual, this bottom provides more polish.</p>

                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" id="imgsmall" src="../img/fashionfigureprog.png" alt="figure in progress">
                    </a>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Fashion Figure with Description Callouts</span>

                    <p>Once happy with with the shape of my garments I researched appropriate fabric choices. The bomber jacket is made of printed silk with a contrast collar. The front zipper makes it easy to take on and off. The leather materialization of the skirt was intended to give it a non-conformist look.  

                     <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="../img/fashionfigure.png" alt="figure in progress">
                    </a>

                    <p>The final design was drawn in Adobe Photoshop. The pattern of the garments was inserted by creating new color swatches. The burn and dodge tools were used to shade the garments in order to provide movement and make them appear more lifelike.

                     <h2>Challenges, Constraints, and Criteria</h2>

                    <p>The greatest challenge of the project was relearning to use Adobe Illustrator. Although I have prior experience in fashion design, I quickly learned that 4 years is plenty of time to become rusty! The constraints of this project involved it taking place in one day. It was difficult to design without having done market research and gone through rounds of cuts before coming up with a final concept. The relationship between concept and execution was constrained as the limited time frame did not allow for the garment to be physically assembled. The criteria of project was to be womenswear targeted at consumers between 20-35 years old. Were I to do another iteration on this project, I would complete the designs for an entire line.</p>

                    <p>This project is far from complete. I believe that fashion is always evolving, and in order to reimagine the complete wardrobe of a woman working in the technology field one would need to create complete several seasonal collections. I believe that it was a useful exercise for me to picture my own evolution as a creative technologist. Being comfortable in what one is wearing provides confidence, and confidence puts me in the best mindset for creativity.</p>
